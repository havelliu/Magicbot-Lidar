First, make sure you have ROS installed on your Beaglebone, robot laptop, and your remote laptop. 
Follow the instructions online about installing ROS Kinetic Kame, and make sure everything is
updated.

Next, access your Beaglebone and create a catkin workspace. Then, run the terminal command 
"catkin_make" to automatically configure the workspace. Next, within the src folder, create a 
folder called "magicbot_ros". This will house all of your code to actually run the robot. Now
that you have a folder for the code, create a git repository within the folder and set the 
origin as:

	https://github.com/havelliu/Magicbot---UMich.git

Pull from this repository to get all of the source code as well as the necessary package.xml and 
CMake files.  ||| Once you have downloaded everything, go back to the catkin workspace directory
you created and run the terminal command "catkin_make" to compile the workspace. Finally, we
need to make sure we're running the robotics cape commands as the root user, so type in the
following terminal commands:

	sudo chown root:root ~/(YOUR_CATKIN_WORKSPACE_NAME)/devel/lib/magicbot_ros/magicbot_ros
	sudo chmod u+s ~/(YOUR_CATKIN_WORKSPACE_NAME)/devel/lib/magicbot_ros/magicbot_ros

Your Beaglebone should be ready. Next, we can move on the the robot laptop. First, create a
catkin workspace and run "catkin_make" to configure the workspace. Next, go into the src folder
and initialize a git repository with the origin set as:

	https://github.com/havelliu/Magicbot-Lidar.git

Pull from this repository to get the launch files for the lidar sensor. Next, download the
necessary ROS packages using the following terminal commands:

	sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-velodyne
	sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-pointcloud-to-laserscan
	sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-turtlebot3

Lastly, you'll need to go and modify the turtlebot files to run with the magicbot. The 
turtlebot3 package contains multiple sub-packages to run the turtlebot3 robot. The first
package we'll need to modify on the robot laptop is the turtlebot3_bringup package. 
The launch files for ROS packages installed through apt-get will be located in the root
directory, so you'll need to run these terminal commands:

	cd //
	cd opt/ros/kinetic/share/turtlebot3_bringup/launch

This should bring you to the launch folder of the turtlebot3_bringup package. You will see
multiple launch files. Using admin privileges, open up the file "turtlebot3_robot.launch"
with a text editor.
